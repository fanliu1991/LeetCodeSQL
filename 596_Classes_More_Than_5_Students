There is a table courses with columns: student and class

Please list out all classes which have more than or equal to 5 students.

Note:
The students should not be counted duplicate in each course.

For example, the table:

+---------+------------+
| student | class      |
+---------+------------+
| A       | Math       |
| B       | English    |
| C       | Math       |
| D       | Biology    |
| E       | Math       |
| F       | Computer   |
| G       | Math       |
| H       | Math       |
| I       | Math       |
+---------+------------+
Should output:

+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+


Approach: Using GROUP BY and HAVING condition

To get the student number in each class, we can use GROUP BY and COUNT, 
HAVING is a simpler and natural approach to add some condition to a GROUP BY clause.

SELECT c.class
FROM courses c
GROUP BY c.class
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT c.student) >= 5
