Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+

For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+



Consecutive appearing means the Id of the Num are next to each others. 
Since this problem asks for numbers appearing at least three times consecutively, we can use 3 aliases for this table Logs, 
and then check whether 3 consecutive numbers are all the same.

We need to add a keyword DISTINCT because it will display a duplicated number if one number appears more than 3 times consecutively.

Approach 1: Using DISTINCT and WHERE clause

SELECT DISTINCT l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums 
FROM Logs l1, Logs l2, Logs l3
WHERE l1.Id = l2.Id - 1 AND l2.Id = l3.Id - 1 AND l1.Num = l2.Num AND l2.Num = l3.Num


Approach 2:

SELECT DISTINCT l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums 
FROM Logs l1 
INNER JOIN Logs l2
ON l1.Id = l2.Id - 1 AND l1.Num = l2.Num
INNER JOIN Logs l3
ON l1.Id = l3.Id - 2 AND l1.Num = l3.Num
