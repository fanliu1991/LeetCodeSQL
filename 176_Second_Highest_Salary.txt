Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+


Sort the distinct salary in descend order and then utilize the OFFSET and FETCH clause to get the second highest salary.

The inner query will be judged as 'Wrong Answer' if there is no such second highest salary since there might be only one record in this table.
To overcome this issue, we can take this as a temp table, and apply an outer query.

SELECT(
    SELECT DISTINCT Salary
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY Salary DESC 
    OFFSET 1 ROWS
    FETCH NEXT 1 ROWS ONLY
    ) AS SecondHighestSalary


If there is only one record in the database, inner query produces
  SecondHighestSalary
    <empty cell>

where with outer query, produces
  SecondHighestSalary
        null
