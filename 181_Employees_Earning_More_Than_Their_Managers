The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

1. Using WHERE clause:

Select from two tables will get the Cartesian product of these two tables. 
However, what we interest is the employee's salary higher than his/her manager. 
So we should add two conditions in a WHERE clause like below.

SELECT e.Name AS Employee 
FROM Employee e, Employee m
WHERE e.ManagerId = m.Id AND e.Salary > m.Salary 


2. Using JOIN clause:

JOIN is a more common and efficient way to link tables together, and we can use ON to specify some conditions.

SELECT e.NAME AS Employee
FROM Employee e INNER JOIN Employee m
ON e.ManagerId = m.Id AND e.Salary > m.Salary
